# Fake_news_detection

A machine learning project to classify news as real or fake using Sentence-BERT embeddings and traditional classifiers.

## Features
- Uses Sentence-BERT for semantic text embeddings.
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.
- Balanced dataset and text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization).
- Evaluation via F1-score and confusion matrix.
- Visualizations with seaborn and word clouds.
- Deployed locally using Streamlit for real-time prediction.

## Run
`streamlit run app 1.py`
